Shot Logger
==========

Shot Logger facilitates the analysis of visual style in film and television.

As of 2023, Shot Logger is no longer being actively developed. The files in
this GIThub repository are freely available for others to fork, but
there are problems with the admin section that are not going to be solved
by me. Please use them for whatever you'd like.

The demise of Shot Logger as a functioning service began when PHP 7
deprecated the mysql_ extension. Much of our code was based on that extension.
We were able to convert key files to PDO (PHP Data Object), an extension that
is said to be more flexible and powerful than mysql_. However, we do not
have the resources to convert properly the admin files.

Thus, the admin section is a bit of a mess. 

Let me know if you're able to make something useful out of Shot Logger's
files!

Sincerely,
