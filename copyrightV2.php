<h1>Copyright,  Fair Use, &amp; Source Code</h1>
<p>The images from television programs and films on Shot Logger are used for critical, teaching, and scholarship purposes. It is our understanding of <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/title17/92chap1.html#107" target="_blank">Section 107 &quot;Limitations on Exclusive Rights: Fair Use</a>&quot; of U.S. copyright law that these purposes constitute &quot;fair use&quot; of copyrighted material. </p>
<p>We believe that our use of television and film images passes the &quot;<a href="http://copyright.columbia.edu/copyright/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/" target="_blank">Four Factor Fair Use Test</a>&quot; that encapsulates the main provisions of Section 107. Moreover, we believe that the arguments made in favor of fair use in Kristin Thompson&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://www.cmstudies.org/resource/resmgr/docs/fairusefilmstills.pdf" target="_blank">Fair Usage Publication of Film Stills</a>&quot; and the Society for Cinema and Media Studies' &quot;<a href="http://www.cmstudies.org/resource/resmgr/files/scms_publishing_statement_-.pdf" target="_blank">Best Practices For Fair Use in Teaching</a>&quot; should also apply here.</p>
<p>However, <strong>we do not wish to infringe upon any copyrights</strong>. If you are a copyright holder and you believe our use of an image infringes upon your copyright, please notify us and we will immediately remove that image from Shot Logger.</p>
